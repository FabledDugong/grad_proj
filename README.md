#### Admin
All present users have the same IOPL.
The reason for that is this web app will
be accessed only by the owner and her co-workers
and the only thing they have control over are the
news at the beginning of `index.php`.

Access the administration through url @
`/admin.php` and use the following login
info (only during graduation).

acc: `vedouci` pass: `X6]+7@ic;t7.Z5`

acc: `oponent` pass: `+k5,*7#wY_?7.g`
